# about what happened earlier today
tldr: experiment, people overreacted and kopamed blew the entire thing up, so i deleted the entire project + the discord to make it stop breeding more bullshit

longer explanation:
i had an idea on a larger update i made

i wanted to see how many people would actually run software they had no idea of

so to put it short: i put code into the utils class that sent me basic info about the user who ran it, + some more private data so i could actually prove i had the data

now, you might think that "omg this is super bad!!!!", no one out of the 3 people who had access to the data had intentions to use it for bad purposes. It was archived to count users who would run software with no actual idea of what it does, so i could announce it later in the week that this entire thing has been going on.

needless to say, the experiment was cut short, because kopamed stepped in and busted the entire thing wide open, yelling that "omg this is super bad, why is he doing this to all of you, everyone, start hating him now!!!!"

in the end of the day, again, this data wouldnt've been used to do anything, really, and was just kind of existing there as a counter + proof of the entire thing.

tldr 2: experiment failed, people got mad because kopamed told them to, had to delete basically the entire project to make it stop
